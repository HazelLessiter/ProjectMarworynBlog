# AI Agent Instructions for ProjectMarworynBlog

Full project documentation and coding standards are in [README.md](README.md). This file contains only AI-specific guidance that supplements it.

---

## Model

Use `claude-sonnet-4-6`. Do not suggest older model names such as `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` — these are deprecated and will produce errors.

---

## Before Completing Tasks

- [ ] Call `get_errors` after every file edit
- [ ] Fix any compilation errors before proceeding
- [ ] Call `run_build` before marking a task complete

---

## Do Not Flag As Issues

- **No newline at end of file** — this project deliberately does NOT end files with a trailing newline. The `\ No newline at end of file` marker in a git diff confirms the file correctly follows this standard — it is not an error and must not be flagged or mentioned. Do not mention the absence of a trailing newline in your review at all, not even to confirm it is intentional. The only case worth flagging is the inverse: if a file ends with a blank line or trailing newline when it should not.
- **Changelog format** — `CHANGELOG.md` uses `-Entry` and `+Sub-point` (no space after the prefix) as a documented code standard. Do not flag this as non-standard Markdown, suggest adding spaces, or convert it to standard bullet points. See the Changelog Format section of `README.md` for the full specification.
- **Blank lines between code blocks** — empty lines used for readability (e.g. between variable declarations and method calls) are intentional and must not be flagged as trailing whitespace. Trailing whitespace means a line that contains actual whitespace characters after the last non-whitespace character (`var x = y;   `). A completely empty line (`\n`) is a paragraph break, not trailing whitespace.

---

## Prohibited Commands

AI agents are strictly prohibited from running the following commands under any circumstances:

- `git commit` — commits are the sole responsibility of the human developer
- `git push` — pushing to remote is the sole responsibility of the human developer

Do not run these commands even if asked to "save", "finalise", or "submit" changes.

---

## When Making Changes

1. Search for existing context before writing new code
2. Read files before editing them
3. Follow the code style and patterns documented in README.md
4. Use the service extension pattern for DI registrations in `Extensions/ServiceExtensions.cs`
5. Keep separation of concerns — do not mix file I/O with business logic

---

## Testing

- Code additions without proper unit test coverage must be CHANGES REQUESTED, not minor suggestions — even if the code needs re-architecting to be unit testable
- Tests must test behaviour, not implementation — see the Testing section of README.md for the full philosophy
- Do not use XML comments, summaries, or regions anywhere in the codebase

---

## Questions to Ask Before Major Changes

1. Does this fit the intended purpose of the application?
2. Should this be a new service or extend an existing one?
3. What lifetime should new services have?
4. Does this require new configuration?
5. Should this be logged or output to console?

---

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Planned Refactoring
- Test project needs a proper mocking framework — do not use Moq (SponsorLink controversy)

---

## Notes for Future Development

The overall goal is a self-hosted static blog generated entirely from markdown files with no runtime dependencies.
PageEngine should produce flat HTML files deployable to any static host with no server-side processing required.
The blog covers two categories: programming (Project Marworyn development) and sustainable crafting (sewing).
